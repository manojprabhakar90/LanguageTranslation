# Language Translation

# Introduction:

Ever wondered how google translate works. When we are stuck in some foreign land that doesnt converse in English, the first thing we consider is to use Google translate and try to converse in local language. Translation is the process of converting text or speech from one language into another. Translation is important in many aspects. 

Translation can help in travel and tourism, translation helps in navigating foreign countries, understand their language, converse and understand their customs. 

Translation can also help in Research and Education. When someone has published research in their local language and there is no equivalent in English, translation can help. 

Translation bridges linguistic gaps, fostering communication, understanding, and collaboration among people from different linguistic backgrounds. It is a cornerstone of global interaction, essential for the flow of information and ideas in our increasingly interconnected world. 

There are around 3.6% of world population that converse in French.
